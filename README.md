Budgeteer

This repository contains the frontend of the project; the backend can be found [here](https://github.com/ryansperzel/budgeteer-backend)

### Frontend

The component-based **JavaScript** frontend was built with **React**. We used **Semantic UI React** along with custom **CSS** to style the frontend. **Chart.js** was used to display expenditure data.

### Backend

The backend API was built with **Ruby on Rails**, and we used **PostgreSQL** for the database.
